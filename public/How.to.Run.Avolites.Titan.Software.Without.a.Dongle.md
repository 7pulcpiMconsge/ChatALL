## Method 1: Use Avolites Titan PC Suite V11.4 or Earlier
 
One of the easiest ways to run Avolites Titan software without a dongle is to use an older version of the software that does not require one. According to a Reddit post[^1^], you can run Avolites Titan PC Suite V11.4 or earlier in a simulator mode to try out the software. V12 or newer requires an authentication USB key.
 
To use this method, you need to download Avolites Titan PC Suite V11.4 or earlier from the Avolites website or other sources. You also need to create an account with Avolites and obtain a free digital license key from them. This video[^1^] guides you through the steps for obtaining the license.
 
Once you have installed the software and obtained the license, you can run Avolites Titan Simulator and use it as a virtual console on your desktop. You can also connect it to an external DMX interface if you have one, such as the Avolites Titan One or Titan Go.
 
The benefits of this method are that it is free, easy, and legal. You can use most of the features of Avolites Titan software and learn how to program and control lighting shows. The drawbacks are that you are limited to an older version of the software that may not have all the latest updates and improvements. You also cannot use it with newer Avolites consoles or interfaces that require V12 or newer.
 
## Method 2: Use a Dongle Emulator
 
Another way to run Avolites Titan software without a dongle is to use a dongle emulator. A dongle emulator is a software that mimics the function of a hardware dongle, allowing you to run protected software without the original dongle. There are various dongle emulators available online, such as Sentinel Emulator, HASP Emulator, Aladdin Emulator, etc.
 
To use this method, you need to download a dongle emulator that is compatible with Avolites Titan software and your operating system. You also need to obtain a dump file of the original dongle, which is a copy of its data and memory. This can be done by using a special device or software that can read and write dongles. Alternatively, you can search for dump files online, but they may not be reliable or safe.
 
Once you have installed the dongle emulator and loaded the dump file, you can run Avolites Titan software as if you had the original dongle connected. You can use any version of the software and any Avolites console or interface that supports it.
 
The benefits of this method are that it is flexible and versatile. You can use any version of Avolites Titan software and any compatible hardware without buying or carrying a dongle. The drawbacks are that it is illegal and unethical. You are violating the terms and conditions of Avolites Titan software and infringing on their intellectual property rights. You are also risking your computer's security and stability by using unverified and potentially malicious software.
